# NOTES — BrightID Anti-Sybil Fork

## Why I forked this

This fork is based on the **BrightID Anti-Sybil** project — a repository that explores
methods for identifying and mitigating Sybil attacks in decentralized networks.
Sybil attacks occur when a single adversarial actor creates many fake identities in
order to influence or distort a system.

I am studying this code in the context of **trust, integrity, and abuse patterns in
platform systems**.  
My goal is to understand the *mechanisms of identity distortion* and how graph-based
signals can help anticipate or surface coordinated misuse.

## What this codebase implements

BrightID Anti-Sybil provides:
- Utilities for loading and working with network graphs
- Graph algorithms that measure structural properties
- Tools for evaluating clustering and connectivity patterns
- Example datasets and evaluation code

These components reflect common techniques in **network analysis** and structural
signal extraction.

## Why this matters for platform integrity

On dating or relationship platforms, Sybil-like behavior shows up as:
- Multiple accounts created rapidly from similar signals (device, network, timing)
- Accounts that interact in tightly connected subgraphs
- Repeated cycles of ban-evasion and account regeneration
- Accounts engaging in coordinated outreach

While not all platforms are decentralized, the underlying *signal reasoning* is the
same: structural patterns often reveal abnormal behavior before message content
does. Being familiar with these patterns helps frame better risk signals.

## What I’m exploring here

- How network structure informs risk without relying on content
- Structural indicators that correlate with coordinated
  or synthetic account clusters
- How to map network integrity signals into practical risk
  tiers for other systems (e.g., dating, social apps)
- What evaluation metrics make sense for network-based risk
